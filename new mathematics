Change in method of Mathematics (from logic to problem solving)

Soon the race between pure mathematician started.. The race of developing the syllogism of the Aristotle to an extend that was applicable to the present world.

FOUNDATION was made what we the young call it set theory, axioms, computation, etc.

This Foundation is the base of the opreations of the universe as we presive it by our sense or understand it as of today.

In the this contemporary world, problem solving is a skill of most valued irrespective of the field and that's where the big bucks and seats are available. Hence, this where logical thinking and problem solving skills development takes over and leaves the mentality of just eating the fish.. now everyone is fishing. 

Rationalism the other word for average.. was coined and as long as you are real you will have rational numbers.. said in all the maths books now.. 


A few goodmen who devoted the time and thinking: 

Ernst Zermelo
Abraham Fraenkel
Gottlob Frege
Kurt GÃ¶del
John von Neumann 
Alan Turing
Srinivasa Ramanujan

Now you are caught up from logic and how foundation was build and how humanity largely shifted from applying to finding solution.
