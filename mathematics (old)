Mathamatics (old)

To Speak about maths a person must require it's complete knowledge as it is a study of truth and all comes down on to it. I will not be teaching any particular topic or any branch of the subject and only be focusing what and why of it.

Counting goes back as far as man can discover the past.

However, as Logic eveloved in the past, the mathamatics of the time grew as well. 

Counting gave us a number system to do arith-matic, Alegbra, Structures, calculus, combinatorics, etc
Counting gave us a method space and changes as well.

This is what we consider pure mathamatics and it gave birth to applied to mathamatics once it was used by professional of the fields like Businessman, Finance, Engineers, Gamblers, doctors, etc

Till modern era or the 1900s & early 2000s all the applied mathmatics used to depends on the minds of the pure mathamaticans as they developed the formulas for a particular field and use to prove it and then the professionals of the field use to apply the formula to drive the desired results and it worked.

These fields of the applied maths where the pure applied their logic with counting and knowlegde of the field was nothing but PROBLEM SOLVING. 

This realization to the pure led to them thinking what is the parttern in it? After all maths is the study of partterns to solve problems.... this question gave birth to the a new world.
