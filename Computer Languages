After the field of Information Technology landed on Ultra large-scale integration (ULSI) (is the process of integrating or embedding millions of transistors on a single silicon semiconductor microchip)
The Field has not developed after that. However, the number of transistors from 1 Transistors to Crafted with 54 billion transistors, the NVIDIA Ampere architecture is the largest 7 nanometer (nm) chip ever built and features six key groundbreaking innovations in 2024.

ULSI Remains the same, the number of Transistor kept on increasing (A transistor is a semiconductor device used to amplify or switch electrical signals and power)

ULSI, which stands for Ultra Large Scale Integration, is a technological process in the field of microelectronics that involves the integration of an exceptionally large number of transistors onto a single semiconductor chip.

After the physical components of a computer are assembled, the next step is to install and configure the software. This process typically involves several steps:

Operating System Installation: The first step is to install the operating system (OS) onto the computer. This involves booting the computer from a bootable installation media (such as a DVD or USB drive) and following the prompts to install the OS onto the computer's storage device (e.g., hard drive or SSD). The OS manages the computer's hardware resources and provides a user interface for interacting with the system.

Device Drivers Installation: Once the operating system is installed, device drivers need to be installed for the various hardware components in the computer. Device drivers are software programs that allow the operating system to communicate with and control hardware devices such as the motherboard, graphics card, network adapter, and peripherals.

Software Updates and Patching: After the initial installation, it's essential to apply any available software updates and patches to ensure that the system is up-to-date and secure. This includes updates for the operating system, device drivers, and other software installed on the computer.

Software Installation: Depending on the intended use of the computer, additional software applications may need to be installed. This could include productivity software (e.g., office suites), multimedia software, development tools, antivirus software, and more. These applications can be installed from installation media or downloaded from the internet.

Configuration and Customization: Once the necessary software is installed, the system can be configured and customized to meet the user's preferences and requirements. This may involve setting up user accounts, configuring network settings, adjusting system settings, and personalizing the user interface.

Data Migration: If the user has data from a previous computer or backup, it may need to be migrated to the new computer. This could involve transferring files and settings, importing email accounts and messages, and migrating other data as needed.

Testing and Optimization: Finally, the system should be thoroughly tested to ensure that everything is functioning correctly. This includes testing hardware components, verifying software functionality, and performing any necessary optimizations or tuning to improve performance and stability.

By completing these steps, the computer is ready for use, tailored to the user's needs, and equipped with the necessary software to perform its intended tasks. Ongoing maintenance, updates, and monitoring will be required to keep the system running smoothly over time.

After Physical and Operating System is developed and installed, a command line interface (CLI) to do calculation/ opreations at a fast pase is ready.
Now we need a language: Shell 

A shell is a command-line interface that provides users with a way to interact with an operating system. It acts as an intermediary between the user and the operating system, allowing users to issue commands and execute programs. Shells provide a powerful and flexible environment for users to perform various tasks, including:

Running Programs: Users can run programs and applications by typing their names or paths into the shell and pressing enter. The shell locates the program, loads it into memory, and executes it.

Managing Files and Directories: Shells allow users to navigate the file system, create, delete, move, copy, and manipulate files and directories. Users can also view file contents, change file permissions, and perform other file-related operations.

Managing Processes: Users can manage processes running on the system using the shell. They can start, stop, suspend, resume, and monitor processes, as well as manage process priorities and resources.

Redirecting Input and Output: Shells support input and output redirection, allowing users to send the output of one command as input to another command, or redirect output to files or devices.

Customization and Automation: Users can customize their shell environment by setting environment variables, defining aliases and functions, and creating shell scripts. Shell scripts are sequences of shell commands that can be saved to files and executed as programs, allowing users to automate tasks and perform complex operations.

Networking: Shells provide commands and utilities for networking tasks such as connecting to remote systems, transferring files over networks, and configuring network settings.

System Administration: Shells are often used by system administrators to perform administrative tasks such as user management, system configuration, monitoring system performance, and troubleshooting.

Overall, shells provide users with a versatile and powerful interface for interacting with the operating system and performing a wide range of tasks efficiently and effectively.
