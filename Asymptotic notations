If it is resource problem, add time
If it is time problem, add resource

BigO is the best in all cases.

Omega (Best Case) notation represents the lower bound of the running time of an algorithm. Thus, it provides the best case complexity of an algorithm.
Theta (Average Case) You add the running times for each possible input combination and take the average in the average case.
Big-O (Worst Case) notation represents the upper bound of the running time of an algorithm. Therefore, it gives the worst-case complexity of an algorithm.
