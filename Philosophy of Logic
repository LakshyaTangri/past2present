The timeline of logic philosophy spans from ancient times to the present day, evolving through various key periods and contributions.
Ancient Greek Philosophy: Logic as a discipline began with Aristotle in the 4th century BCE, who systematized much of the logical inquiry of his predecessors, focusing on deductive inference and term-logic. The Sophists and Plato also displayed early interest in sentence analysis, truth, and fallacies, contributing to the development of logical methods and argumentation.

Medieval Logic: The medieval period saw significant advancements in logic, with the 14th century being an apex of medieval logical theory, marked by an explosion of creative work and the development of supposition theory. Notable figures like Abelard formulated semantic principles and criteria for logical consequences during this time.

Modern Era: In the early modern era, mathematicians like Leibniz envisioned a universal language specified with mathematical precision, aiming to reduce scientific and philosophical speculation to computation. 

Towards the end of the 19th century, different traditions in logic emerged, including the algebraic school focusing on the relationship between reasoning regularities and mathematical operations.

Contemporary Logic: Contemporary logic has become a central part of analytic philosophy, with topics like modal logic, tense logic, deontic logic, and non-standard logic being extensively explored by philosophers like Quine, Kripke, Davidson, and Dummett. The flourishing future of logics continues to be shaped by ongoing research and applications in various fields like computer science, artificial intelligence, and mathematics.

Throughout history, the development of logic philosophy has been intertwined with general philosophy, influencing and being influenced by various philosophical traditions and movements. 

From the ancient Greeks to modern-day scholars, the evolution of logic philosophy reflects a continuous quest to understand the nature of reasoning, inference, and truth.
